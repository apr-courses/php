One user costs 10$. The total count of users is 2000;

The userID is the same as serial number in the list. (from 0 to 2000);

The ID's 0, 1, 10, 11, 22 - administrators, we don't need to calculate them.
The ID's 101, 202, 203 - use project as trial - they cost 5$.

Provide the code, that calculate the total platform cost by using:
