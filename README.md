[
  {
    "id": "userId",
    "name": "fullname",
    "company": "Apriorit",
    "email": "mymail@site.com",
    "age": "29",
  },
  ...
]
```

1. Find all active users in json structure.
2. For the active users change the company name to `Apriorit`.
3. Create a new json structure for them.
4. For the new Atriorit users, find the users with the age less than 25 years old and add extra parameter to it's data {"isStudent:": "true" }.
5. Print the user emails to console that have `isStudent` parameter.
